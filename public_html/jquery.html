<p class="pac">What is life for a n**** like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, n****
        </p>
        <p class="big">[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothaf**ka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch

        <p class="pac">I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
N**** praying up to God just hoping that he hear a n****
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
        </p>
        <p class="sch">To all my n****s I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
    To all my n****s that'll never make it out the streets</p>

        <p class="pac">F**k it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my n****s first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my n****s that's gon' f**k around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say</p>
    

        <p class="sch">[Hook]
Stay blessed my n****, blessed my n****
Really think about it, could be worse my n****
Don't stress my n****, yes, my n****
We all blessed my n****!!</p>

        <p class="pac">[Verse 2]
Now how the f**k I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my n**** just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, f**k that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
F**k it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a n**** couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a f**kin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"F**k police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a n**** proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son</p>

<p class="sch">[Hook]
Stay blessed my n****, blessed my n****
Really think about it, could be worse my n****
Don't stress my n****, yes, my n****
We all blessed my n****!!</p>

<p class="pac">[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere and I'mma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'mma always be right here</p>

<p class="sch">[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Living in a premature place... wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates... break
Every time a bullet detonate... dates... of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed, my n****)
 </p>
<p class="pac">Yes, my n****, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my n****
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my n****
You reject these n****s that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my n****
Step-step my n****, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, f**k n****s, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of f**k n****s, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all</p>

 <p class="sch">[Hook]
Stay blessed my n****, blessed my n****
Really think about it, could be worse my n****
Don't stress my n****, yes, my n****
We all blessed my n****</p>

Had pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Oxy's
Whole life I been a G, had bitches on the block
Had strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot
Got fiends at the door, so I turned that to a rock

I'm a drug dealing n****, cause them grades ain't get me paid
My agenda for today is to make bread or get laid
See my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime
So I'm standing by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes
Keep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi
Know my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that her-on, look like toffee
Keep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play
Most my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night
But her old ass sixty something, so three hours late aight
Still I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place
And became a f**ing G, moved my crack across the street</p>

I'm a drug dealing n****, roll my cyc' on Hoover's street
Just a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free
Didn't know what he was saying 'til them years done jumped to three
Learned the game, slanging hoes and every car door need a key
Charge them smokers day through night, selling pies who need a slice
Life is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice
Enemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack it's Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay
Off the yee like it's the bay, rock a chain I'm Kunta K
Out in Texas what's the word, keep them packs and that's for sure
Slang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur

                Rock ultimately chose to take rapping over street life, after Anthony Tiffith, 
                CEO of indie record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), 
                found Rock in 2005 and signed him to his label.[1] 
                In 2007, Rock, alongside Top Dawg, secured a recording contract with Warner Bros. 
                Records and later Asylum Records, 
                but after both mergers fell through, the label linked up with Strange Music,
